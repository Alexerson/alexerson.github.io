Welcome to my personal website!

I'm delighted to have you here. I’m **Alexandre Spaeth**, co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of[e180, the creators of Braindate](https://braindate.com).

With a passion for technology and a love for innovation, I’m deeply interested in Python and Django. I love the simplicity of tools like HTMX and AlpineJS, but don’t disregard new development in the web standards in general.

One of my focus is also peer-to-peer education and training. I believe in the transformative power of knowledge-sharing and the incredible potential it holds. Embracing this belief, I seek opportunities to foster collaborative learning environments where individuals can connect, exchange ideas, and grow together.
